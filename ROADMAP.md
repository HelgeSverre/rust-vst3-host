# VST3-Host Continuation Roadmap

> Resumed after ~1 year dormant. Derived from a verified multi-agent state review
> (7 subsystems, 20 adversarially-confirmed findings) on 2026-06-19.
> The grand vision: a **safe, batteries-included VST3 hosting library** — load &
> play a plugin in <10 lines, zero unsafe in the public API, process isolation by
> default, CPAL + egui included, cross-platform.

## State at resume

Extraction is ~40% real / ~70% surface. The in-process load path
(`simple::load_plugin → Vst3Host::load_plugin → PluginImpl::load`) genuinely works
on macOS with safe COM wrapping + RAII teardown. But the headline pillars are not
delivered: no `CpalBackend→Plugin` audio glue (no sound), process isolation is
opt-in and load-only, the only consumer (`vst3-inspector`) ignores the library, all
4 examples + the integration test fail to compile, and ~1700 LOC of dead scaffolding
clutter the tree.

**Acceptance gate (overall):** `cargo test --workspace --all-features` green AND all
examples compile, reached phase by phase.

## Phase 0 — Honest green baseline  ✅ DONE (commits d84ed4a, 948b907, + 0d)
- [x] 0a. Delete orphaned scaffolding: `realtime.rs`, `audio_processing.rs`,
  `stream.rs`, root `com_implementations.rs`, `api_simplification.rs`,
  `error_improvements.rs`. (RT-safe design ideas in `realtime.rs` are recoverable
  from git commit `d20eec2` if Phase 3 wants them — they reference a missing
  `crossbeam` dep and a stale duplicate COM impl, so they can't be revived as-is.)
- [x] 0b. Export `AudioBackend` / `AudioStream` in crate root + prelude; removed the
  `Result<T>` alias from the prelude glob (it shadowed `std::result::Result`).
- [x] 0c. Fixed example/test API drift — all examples + tests compile;
  `discover_plugins_with_callback` implemented. `cargo test --workspace
  --all-features` green (47 pass, 9 ignored needing real plugins/HW or Phase 1/3).
- [x] 0d. Reconciled docs: README_LIBRARY.md no longer claims isolation-by-default /
  timeout / lock-free / pooling (marked _(planned)_ + link ROADMAP); fixed the
  `simple.rs` docstrings that wrongly said discovery is unimplemented.

## Phase 1 — Batteries-included sound (core promise)  ✅ DONE
- [x] 1b. Ownership model: `Plugin` is `Send` (PluginInternal: Send); playback shares
  it as `Arc<Mutex<Plugin>>` behind an `AudioHandle` so the audio thread pumps it
  while the control thread keeps sending MIDI/params.
- [x] 1a. Wired `CpalBackend → Plugin` in `src/playback.rs`: `play_with_backend`
  (generic over `AudioBackend`) + `Vst3Host::play` + `simple::play`. Pure
  `interleave_outputs` is unit-tested (5 tests). Removed the lying `with_backend`
  no-op stub. **Verified on real hardware**: `play_synth` example loads Dexed and
  produces audio (peak 0.13) through the default output device.
- [x] 1c. `CpalBackend` buffer-size negotiation: clamp to the device's supported
  range or fall back to `BufferSize::Default` (fixes CoreAudio rejecting Fixed);
  channel count kept exact so the interleave stays consistent.

## Phase 2 — Prove consumability + close API gaps
- [ ] 2a. Port `vst3-inspector` onto the library (regression net). ← NEXT BIG SLICE (XL)
- [x] 2b. Implemented `discover_plugins_with_callback` (done in Phase 0c).
- [ ] 2c. `IPlugFrame` resize + egui embedding helper.
- [x] 2d. Parameter display correctness: added `Plugin::format_parameter` which calls
  the controller's `getParamStringByValue` (verified against Dexed — e.g.
  `MonoMode = "POLY"`). Documented `Parameter` min/max as normalized and
  `format_value` as an approximation.
- [x] 2e (partial). `get_output_levels` recovers a poisoned lock instead of panicking.
  Remaining: implement ProgramChange/PitchBend/Aftertouch MIDI events.

## Phase 3 — Make process isolation real (safety pillar)
- [ ] 3a. Extend IPC protocol with control verbs (share the enum from the lib).
- [ ] 3b. Implement verbs in helper + `IsolatedPluginImpl`.
- [ ] 3c. Real timeout + crash recovery.
- [ ] 3d. Build helper under default features; make isolation default *after* it works.

## Phase 4 — Polish
- [ ] 4a. Migrate `window.rs` `cocoa`/`objc` → `objc2` (clears ~51 warnings).
- [ ] 4b. Clear `missing_docs`, escalate to `deny` in CI.
- [ ] 4c. Real COM-level tests (load a bundled `.vst3`, run `process()`, assert cleanup).
- [ ] Delete stub `objc_conflict_resolver.rs` + its misleading log line (real fix is
  in `private_namespace.rs`).
